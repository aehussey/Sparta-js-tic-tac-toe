# Sparta-js-tic-tac-toe


## Task

The task was to create a fully working tic-tac-toe game, including a readout of which player's go it was and a reset button. The game follows the traditional rules and the first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row wins. If neither player is able to manage this, the game is tied. When a player wins or there is a tie, the game is stopped and the result announced.
